# Fly A Kite

A game about flying a kite for the [October 2015 Berlin Minijam](http://vote.berlinminijam.de/jams/38). 
I'd seen many people flying kites in a nearby park, and I wanted to try to simulate that feeling of 
climbing up into the sky and roaring down again.

My first experience with GameMaker, it was pleasingly easy to use despite misgivings about the UI. Art
was done in paint.net.
